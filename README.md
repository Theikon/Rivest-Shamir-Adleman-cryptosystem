# Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem

The repository consists of a paper discussing the mathematical background and
correctness of the RSA cryptosystem, including the means to visualise modular
exponentiation in complete residue systems, as well as an implementation of the
RSA cryptosystem in Pascal.

The purpose of the repository is entirely educational; specifically, do not use
the aforementioned implementation in a production environment.
