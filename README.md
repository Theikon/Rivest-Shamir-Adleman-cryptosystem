# Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem

The repository consists of a
[paper](https://github.com/Theikon/Rivest-Shamir-Adleman-cryptosystem/blob/956374c77261ff46205b1b2e9d4f3e0097795cbb/Rivest-Shamir-Adleman-Kryptosystem.pdf)
discussing the mathematical background and correctness of the RSA cryptosystem,
including the means to visualise modular exponentiation in complete residue
systems, as well as an implementation of the RSA cryptosystem in Pascal.

I recommend the [Free Pascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/) for
building 64-bit executables locally.

Please note that the purpose of the repository is entirely educational;
specifically, do not use the aforementioned implementation in a production
environment.

## Translation

While there is an effort to translate the original German paper into English,
in the meantime, try the file upload functionality of
[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator/files) instead.

## Visualisation
